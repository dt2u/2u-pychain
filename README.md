## Usage
This application allows you to interact with your own blockchain. Each block contains a record
with information on the sender, receiver, and amount. The block is added to the chain
as long as it passes the difficulty of the validation as set in the sidebar.

This app is powered by streamlit. Install the requirements and then run the app with the following command:

`streamlit run pychain.py`
